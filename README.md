# motion
This is my personal project to learn various inverse kinematics and manipulation algorithms. 

The end result will hopefully be both a reusable library and a specific
application with a robot arm that writes on paper.

For a mature robot manipulation library, see [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). If ROS
is too big for your application, then look at
[Open Motion Planning Library](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/) which supports
pretty much any type of planning including robot motion.
